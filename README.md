# TcpTransceiver

Quick and dirty sanbox project to show how to use the TcpClient en TcpListener for duplex communication.
Still need to clean-up and extend the code to add propper reconnect etc...

The TcpBlock is only in the project to show how easy it is to turn stuff into TPL Dataflow components.
